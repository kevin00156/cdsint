"""
codesys_online.py - Report which applications are currently logged into a PLC.

Import writes to the IDE object tree, and CODESYS refuses to create, move or
delete any object belonging to an application you are logged into ("Cannot add
an object because it affects a device you are currently logged into"). Without
this pre-flight that refusal arrives once per object, halfway through an
import, as a wall of SystemError tracebacks that says nothing about the one
thing the user has to do: log out.

Reads the CODESYS 'online' scripting global, so it can only answer inside the
IDE. Outside it - or when the online API declines to answer - it reports
nothing logged in: a pre-flight that cannot see must not block work it has no
evidence against.
