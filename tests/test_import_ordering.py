"""Regression test for parent-before-child ST import ordering.

Methods/actions/properties of a POU are stored on disk as "<Parent>.<Child>.st"
and must be created AFTER their parent "<Parent>.st" exists. The disk scan
returns files in alphabetical order, where "<FB>.Method.st" sorts BEFORE
"<FB>.st" (the '.' separator is < alphanumerics), so without explicit ordering
the child is processed first, the parent is not found, and the importer used to
fall back to creating a POU with an invalid dotted name. See sync_debug.log:
    "Failed to create MC_BasicControl.DoSetPosition: The name
     'MC_BasicControl.DoSetPosition' is not valid for this object."

order_st_files_parents_first() must put parents first regardless of input order.
