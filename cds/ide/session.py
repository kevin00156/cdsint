"""Install a watcher into a running IDE, and take it back out.

Everything here exists because the script that starts the watcher has to end.
While a script runs the main thread belongs to it, and system.delay() pumps
repaints and posted messages but NOT mouse and keyboard — the window looks
alive and cannot be clicked. So the script arms a WinForms timer and returns,
and the watcher lives on in the IDE's own message loop
(docs/WATCHER.md 6; do not undo this without reading that section).

Two consequences shape this module. The watcher has to be kept somewhere that
outlives the script's namespace, which is why it is parked on `sys`. And the
timer has to be created through .NET, which is why nothing here runs under
CPython — the testable half is cds/ide/watcher.py.
