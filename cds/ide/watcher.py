"""What one IDE's watcher does on each tick: claim a command, answer it, beat.

Nothing here starts or stops a watcher — cds/ide/session.py does that, and it
does it by arming a timer and letting the script end, because a script that
keeps running holds the main thread and leaves the IDE unclickable
(docs/WATCHER.md 6). Keeping that half out of this file is what lets this
half be tested under CPython.

Ticks land on the UI thread, so object-model calls from them are legal and no
cross-thread machinery is needed. No threads, no time.sleep(), no
execute_on_primary_thread (SP21 removed it).

A command is claimed by deleting its file *before* running it. The plan had
the delete last, but a watcher that dies mid-import would then find the same
import queued again on restart. A lost result costs the caller a timeout; a
repeated import costs it a project.
