"""The drop box: the CLI leaves a command, the watcher leaves a result.

A command file name is "<13-digit millisecond stamp>-<6 hex>.json", so plain
alphabetical order is oldest-first and two commands issued in the same
millisecond still get separate files. The watcher takes one at a time, writes
the result under the same id, then deletes the command.

The CLI deletes each result once it has read it. Results nobody came back for
(the CLI was killed, say) are swept by the watcher on its next start.

Pure Python (PRINCIPLES.md 4): no CODESYS imports.
